# Learning Process 

### What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line. 
Learning a concept in depth and being able to explain it in simple terms, as if teaching another person.  

### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The pinball analogy was very interesting to me as it talks about two states of the mind. The focus state and the diffuse state. The focus state helps us concentrate and get work done, it also slows down innovative. But the diffuse state is almost like a relaxed state when the brain has lesser obstacles which can lead to quicker idea generation. The idea is to move between these two states of our mind to get optimal output.

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
Active mode is also called focused state wherein the mind is concentrating on getting the work done and there is less room for innovation. The diffused state is a more relaxed state of mind which helps us innovate and come up with good ideas.

### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
- Deconstruct the skill.
- Learn enough to self correct.
- Remove practice barriers.
- Practice atleast 20 hours.

### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
Some actions that can be taken to improve learning process:
- Keep cellphone notifications(of social media apps) on silent before starting work.
- Try to inculcate deep learning to get more work done in less time.
- Use productivity apps like boosted.
- Try teaching a few concepts to a peer to solidify understanding of a concept. 
- Using the Feynman Technique.
